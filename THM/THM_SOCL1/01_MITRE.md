# MITRE & Cyber Defence Frameworks

**Source:** TryHackMe SOC Level 1 – Module: Cyber Defence Frameworks  
**Room(s):** MITRE (9), Cyber Kill Chain (6)

**Objective:** Understand attacker techniques and map them to MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Steps Performed:**
1. Reviewed MITRE ATT&CK matrix for relevant techniques.
2. Identified techniques used in simulated attacks in lab.
3. Documented potential detection rules.

**Findings / IOCs:**
- Example Technique: T1110 – Brute Force
- Example Technique: T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter

**Response / Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Implement monitoring for T1110 and T1059 events.
- Map alerts to SOC triage workflow.

**MITRE Mapping:** See above techniques
