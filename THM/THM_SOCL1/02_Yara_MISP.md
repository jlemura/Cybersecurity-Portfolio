# YARA & MISP Threat Intelligence

**Source:** TryHackMe SOC Level 1 â€“ Module: Cyber Threat Intelligence  

**Objective:**  
Develop the ability to detect threats using YARA rules and analyze threat intelligence in MISP, integrating findings into SOC detection workflows.

---

## Methodology

1. Created custom YARA rules to identify suspicious binaries and malware patterns.  
2. Imported threat events and IOCs into MISP for centralised threat intelligence management.  
3. Cross-referenced IOCs against lab datasets to validate malicious activity and verify detection.  
4. Documented findings for SOC monitoring and mitigation planning.

## Key Findings / Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

| Tool | Example IOC | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| YARA | Custom rule detecting ransomware hash patterns | Successfully flagged test binaries exhibiting malicious characteristics. |
| MISP | IP `10.0.0.5` | Identified as malicious within lab threat feed; linked to simulated attack scenario. |

---

## Response and Mitigation Recommendations

- Deploy verified YARA rules across endpoints to detect suspicious files in real-time.  
- Continuously update SOC alerts and detection rules using MISP threat intelligence feeds.  
- Incorporate cross-referenced IOCs into incident response playbooks for triage and escalation.  
- Regularly validate YARA rules and MISP events against new threat datasets to ensure accuracy.

## Summary

This module demonstrates the ability to:

- Create and apply YARA rules for malware detection.  
- Import, analyze, and correlate threat intelligence using MISP.  
- Identify, validate, and document IOCs to enhance SOC monitoring and response.  
- Translate threat intelligence into actionable SOC detection rules and incident response workflows.
