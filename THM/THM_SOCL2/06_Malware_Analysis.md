# 06_Malware_Analysis

## **COMING SOON**

**Source:** TryHackMe SOC Level 2 â€“ Module: Malware Analysis  
**Room:** Basic Dynamic Analysis

**Objective:**  
Perform dynamic malware analysis to observe runtime behaviour and extract indicators.

---

## Methodology

1. Ran lab malware samples in a sandbox environment.  
2. Monitored file, process, and network activity.  
3. Correlated behaviours to identify suspicious actions.

## Key Findings / Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

| Phase | Example IOC | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Dynamic | Outbound connection to `malicious.c2.example` | Observed runtime C2 communication |

---

## Response & Mitigation Recommendations

- Deploy IOCs in SOC detection platforms.  
- Block identified domains/IPs at the perimeter.  
- Share findings with threat intelligence feeds.

## Summary

Demonstrates ability to:

- Perform dynamic malware analysis safely.  
- Identify runtime malicious behaviour.  
- Extract actionable IOCs for SOC monitoring and detection.
